# Heavily-Commented Solana Exchange Booth

This is a solution to the Exchange Booth project given by Jarry Xiao at the Solana Bootcamp. [See the project spec](https://github.com/jarry-xiao/solana-bootcamp-lectures/tree/master/project_specs).

The code is __not__ production-ready and is only meant to demonstrate the programming model of [Anchor](https://book.anchor-lang.com/chapter_1/what_is_anchor.html), *the Ruby on Rails of Solana*.
